"""WebSocket broadcast server for RideOS telemetry (INFRA-01).

Pattern: asyncio fan-out via a module-level client registry.
- broadcast_loop runs as a sibling asyncio.Task to reconnect_loop in main.py.
- BLE notification callback is a plain def; it posts to broadcast_queue via
  put_nowait (non-blocking). This coroutine drains the queue and fans out JSON
  to all connected clients.
- Uses websockets 16.x asyncio API (NOT the legacy websockets.serve API).
